        "1. In the sense of machine learning, what is a model? What is the best way to train a model?\n",
        "ans:A training model is a dataset that is used to train an ML algorithm. It consists of the sample output data and the corresponding sets of input data that have an influence on the output. \n",
        "The training model is used to run the input data through the algorithm to correlate the processed output against the sample output.\n",

        "2. In the sense of machine learning, explain the \"No Free Lunch\" theorem.\n",
        "Ans: The “no free lunch” (NFL) theorem for supervised machine learning is a \n",
        "theorem that essentially implies that no single machine learning algorithm is universally the best-performing algorithm for all problems.\n",

        "3. Describe the K-fold cross-validation mechanism in detail.\n",
        "Ans: In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as \n",
        "the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k − 1 subsamples are used as training data.\n",

        "4. Describe the bootstrap sampling method. What is the aim of it?\n",
        "Ans:Bootstrapping assigns measures of accuracy (bias, variance,\n",
        " confidence intervals, prediction error, etc.) to sample estimates. This technique allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic using random sampling methods.\n",

        "Ans: Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model .\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Underfitting vs. overfitting the model\n",
        "A model that is underfit will have high training and high testing error while an overfit model will have extremely low training error but a high testing error. \n",
