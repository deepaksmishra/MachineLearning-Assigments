        "1. What is the definition of a target function? In the sense of a real-life example, express the target function. How is a target function's fitness assessed?\n",
        "Ans:A target function, in machine learning, is a method for solving a problem that an AI algorithm parses its training data to find. Once an algorithm finds its target function, that function can be used to predict results (predictive analysis). The function can then be used to find output data related to inputs for real problems where, unlike training sets, outputs are not included.\n",
        "\n",
        "The target function is essentially the formula that an algorithm feeds data to in order to calculate predictions. As in algebra, it is common when training AI to find the variable from the solution, working in reverse. The function as defined by f is applied to the input (I) to produce the output (I), Therefore O= f(I).\n",

        "2. What are predictive models, and how do they work? What are descriptive types, and how do you use them? Examples of both types of models should be provided. Distinguish between these two forms of models.\n",

        "Predictive Analytics: Understanding the future\n",
        "\n",
        "Predictive analytics has its roots in the ability to “predict” what might happen. These analytics are about understanding the future. Predictive analytics provides companies with actionable insights based on data. Predictive analytics provides estimates about the likelihood of a future outcome. It is important to remember that no statistical algorithm can “predict” the future with 100% certainty. Companies use these statistics to forecast what might happen in the future.\n",
        "This is because the foundation of predictive analytics is based on probabilities.\n",

        "3. Describe the method of assessing a classification model's efficiency in detail. Describe the various measurement parameters.\n",
        "Ans: Classification is a supervised learning approach in which a target variable is discrete (or categorical). Evaluating a machine learning model is as important as building it. We are creating models to perform on new, previously unseen data. Hence, a thorough and versatile evaluation is required to create a robust model. When it comes to classification models, evaluation process gets somewhat tricky.\n",
        "In this post, I will try to provide a detailed guide on how to evaluate a classification model including a range of different metrics with their advantages and shortcomings.\n",
        "The concepts I will cover:\n",
        "Classification accuracy\n",

        "Classification Accuracy\n",
        "Classification accuracy shows how many of the predictions are correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "In some cases, it represents how good a model is but there are some cases in which accuracy is simply not enough. For example, 93% means that we correctly predicted 93 out of 100 samples. It seems acceptable without knowing the details of the task.\n",

        "      i. In the sense of machine learning models, what is underfitting? What is the most common reason for underfitting?\n",
        "      ans:Underfitting is the case where the model has “ not learned enough” from the training data, resulting in low generalization and unreliable predictions.\n",
        "As you probably expected, underfitting (i.e. high bias) is just as bad for generalization of the model as overfitting. In high bias, the model might not have enough flexibility in terms of line fitting, resulting in a simplistic line that does not generalize well.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "     ii. What does it mean to overfit? When is it going to happen?\n",
        "     ans:Overfitting is a concept in data science, which occurs when a statistical model fits exactly against its training data. When this happens, the algorithm unfortunately cannot perform accurately against unseen data, defeating its purpose. Generalization of a model to new data is ultimately what allows us to use machine learning algorithms every day to make predictions and classify data.\n",

        "Ans: Feature Prediction Modeling: Referring back to my example regarding age and fitness scores, we can model the relationship between age and fitness scores and then use the model to find the expected fitness score for a given age. This can be done via several techniques, including regression, ANOVA, and more.\n",
        "K Nearest Neighbour Imputation: Using KNN imputation, the missing data is filled with a value from another similar sample, and for those who don’t know, the similarity in KNN is determined using a distance function (i.e., Euclidean distance).\n",

        "Ans:If we merge these into a single dataset, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm ought to be able to group their songs into four clusters that somewhat resemble the original four playlists.\n",
        "Before we get started, we may indeed want to check our assumption that songs from these diverse playlists are indeed ‘different’. Of course, visualising more than two features simultaneously on a single chart is challenging. However, if we plot a scatter matrix of all features, colour-coded by playlist, we can see that there are plenty of metric combinations that demonstrate the distinct characteristics of each genre.\n",

        "\n",
        "Predictive modeling can be described as the mathematical problem of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to output variables (y). This is called the problem of function approximation.\n",

        "Ans:Predictive analytics tools are powered by several different models and algorithms that can be applied to wide range of use cases. Determining what predictive modeling techniques are best for your company is key to getting the most out of a predictive analytics solution and leveraging data to make insightful decisions.\n",

        "         Hold-out\n",
        "Hold-out is when you split up your dataset into a ‘train’ and ‘test’ set. The training set is what the model is trained on, and the test set is used to see how well that model performs on unseen data.\n",
        " A common split when using the hold-out method is using 80% of data for training and the remaining 20% of the data for testing\n",
        "         2. Cross-validation by tenfold\n",
        "         10-fold cross validation would perform the fitting procedure a total of ten times, with each fit being performed on a training set consisting of 90% of\n",

        "         In Boosting, every new subset comprises the elements that were misclassified by previous models. Bagging is usually applied where the classifier is unstable and has a high variance. Boosting is usually applied where the classifier is stable and simple and has high bias.\n",
        "         3. The eager learner vs. the lazy learner\n",
        "         A lazy learner delays abstracting from the data until it is asked to make a prediction while an eager learner abstracts away from the data during training and uses this abstraction to make predictions rather than directly compare queries with instances in the dataset.\n",
