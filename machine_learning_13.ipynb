        "Ans: \n",
        "The prior is a probability distribution that represents your uncertainty over  θ before you have sampled any data and attempted to estimate it - usually denoted  π(θ) .\n",
        "The posterior is a probability distribution representing your uncertainty over  θ after you have sampled data - denoted  π(θ|X) . It is a conditional distribution because it conditions on the observed data.\n",

        "From Bayes' theorem we relate the two:\n",
        "\n",

        "Taking a step back, we widely accept that the process of having beliefs about the world, interacting with it, and then updating these beliefs is a fundamental component of learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, computing the posterior from the prior with Bayes' theorem is simply a mathematical formulation of updating your beliefs. In fact, these ideas are at the core of Bayesian statistics, so it's well worth your time becoming familiar with the mechanics of working with them.\n",

        "2. What role does Bayes' theorem play in the concept learning principle?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "Bayes Theorem provides a principled way for calculating a conditional probability. It is a deceptively simple calculation, \n",
        "although it can be used to easily calculate the conditional probability of events where intuition often fails\n",

        "Ans: \n",
        "As this algorithm is fast and efficient, you can use it to make real-time predictions. This algorithm is popular for multi-class predictions. \n",
        "Email services (like Gmail) use this algorithm to figure out whether an email is a spam or not.\n",

        "4. Can the Nave Bayes classifier be used on continuous numeric data? If so, how can you go about doing it?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        " how do we perform classification using Naive Bayes when the data we have is continuous in nature. If an instance in test data set has a category that was not present during training then it will assign it “Zero” probability and won't be able to make prediction. \n",

Let I be the random variable that indicates whether someone is an intruder I = 1) or not I = 0), and A be the variable that indicates alarm I = 0). If an intruder is detected with probability P(A = 1|I = 1) = 0.98 and a non-intruder is detected with probability P(A = 1|I = 0) = 0.001, an alarm will be triggered, implying the error factor. The likelihood of an intruder in the passenger population is P(I = 1) = 0.00001. What are the chances that an alarm would be triggered when an individual is actually an intruder?\n",

        "\n",
        "Bayesian networks are probabilistic, because these networks are built from a probability distribution, and also use probability theory for prediction and anomaly detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real world applications are probabilistic in nature, and to represent the relationship between multiple events, we need a Bayesian network. It can also be used in various tasks including prediction, anomaly detection, diagnostics, automated insight, reasoning, time series prediction, and decision making under uncertainty.\n",

An antibiotic resistance test (random variable T) has 1% false positives (i.e., 1% of those who are not immune to an antibiotic display a positive result in the test) and 5% false negatives (i.e., 1% of those who are not resistant to an antibiotic show a positive result in the test) (i.e. 5 percent of those actually resistant to an antibiotic test negative). Assume that 2% of those who were screened were antibiotic-resistant. Calculate the likelihood that a person who tests positive is actually immune (random variable D).\n",
