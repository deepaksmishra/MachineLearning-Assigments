        "1. What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.\n",
        "Ans:Human learning is a process of acquiring knowledge. Our behavior, skills, values and ethics are acquired when we process information through our minds and learn. Human learning may occur as part of education, personal development or any other informal/formal training. Children learn while they play, experiment, and interact. However, the process of learning is a continuous process. We constantly learn, unlearn and relearn through our experiences. To express ideas, to inform people, to communicate, to create etc we need to learn.Learning is “a process that leads to change, \n",
        "which occurs as a result of experience and increases the potential for improved performance and future learning”\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?\n",
        "Ans: In supervised learning, a computer program is given a training dataset that is labelled with corresponding output values, and a function will be determined based on this dataset (Kotsiantis et al., 2007)\n",
        "Supervised learning is similar to concept learning (Bruner & Austin, 1986), where a person is required to classify new objects into existing categories,\n",
        " by matching the features of the new objects to examples in the categories\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is machine learning, and how does it work? What are the key responsibilities of machine learning?\n",
        "Ans: Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n",
        " Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Define the terms \"penalty\" and \"reward\" in the context of reinforcement learning.\n",
        "Ans: A reinforcement learning algorithm, which may also be referred to as an agent, learns by interacting with its environment. The agent receives rewards by performing correctly and penalties for performing incorrectly.\n",
        " The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Explain the term \"learning as a search\"?\n",
        "Ans: A Gentle Introduction to Applied Machine Learning as a Search Problem.\n",

        "The K Means Clustering algorithm is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used to categorise unlabelled data, i.e. data without defined categories or groups. The algorithm works by finding groups within the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. \n",

        "Decision Trees (Supervised Learning – Classification/Regression)\n",
        "A decision tree is a flow-chart-like tree structure that uses a branching method to illustrate every possible outcome of a decision. Each node within the tree represents a test on a specific variable – and each branch is the outcome of that test.\n",

        "iii. Studying without supervision\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is not provided with any pre-assigned labels or scores for the training data. As a result, \n",
        "unsupervised learning algorithms must first self-discover any naturally occurring patterns in that training data set. \n",
        "\n",

        "Ans: \n",
        "Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error."
