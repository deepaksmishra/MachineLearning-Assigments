        "Ans: \n",
        "step1:  Prepare the data\n",
        "This is a good time to visualize your data and check if there are correlations between the different characteristics that we obtained. It will be necessary to make a selection of characteristics since the ones you choose will directly impact the execution times and the results. You can also reduce dimensions by applying PCA if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "step2 : Choose the model\n",
        "There are several models that you can choose according to the objective that you might have: you will use algorithms of classification, prediction, linear regression, clustering, i.e. k-means or K-Nearest Neighbor, Deep Learning, i.e Neural Networks, Bayesian, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are various models to be used depending on the data you are going to process such as images, sound, text, and numerical values. In the following table, we will see some models and their applications that you can apply in your projects:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "step3: Train your machine model\n",
        "You will need to train the datasets to run smoothly and see an incremental improvement in the prediction rate. Remember to initialize the weights of your model randomly -the weights are the values that multiply or affect the relationships between the inputs \n",
        "and outputs- which will be automatically adjusted by the selected algorithm the more you train them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "step4: Evaluation\n",
        "You will have to check the machine created against your evaluation data set that contains inputs that the model does not know and verify the precision of your already trained model. If the accuracy is less than or equal to 50%, that model will not be useful since it would be like tossing a coin to make decisions.\n",
        "If you reach 90% or more, you can have good confidence in the results that the model gives you.\n",
        "\n",
        "step5: Parameter Tuning\n",
        "If during the evaluation you did not obtain good predictions and your precision is not the minimum desired, it is possible that you have overfitting -or underfitting problems and you must return to the training step before making a new configuration of parameters in your model. You can increase the number of times you iterate your training data- termed epochs. Another important parameter is the one known as the “learning rate”, which is usually \n",
        "a value that multiplies the gradient to gradually bring it closer to the global -or local- minimum to minimize the cost of the function.\n",

        "2. What are the different forms of data used in machine learning? Give a specific example for each of them.\n",
        "Ans: Numerical Data   : Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers. Statisticians also might call numerical data, quantitative data. This data has meaning as a measurement such as house prices or as a count, such as a number of residential properties in Los Angeles or how many houses sold in the past year.\n",
        "Categorical Data :  Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a hockey player’s position, team, hometown. Categorical data can take numerical values. For example, maybe we would use 1 for the colour red and 2 for blue. But these numbers don’t have a mathematical meaning. That is, we can’t add them together or take the average.\n",
        "Time Series Data:   Time series data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time. It is very important, especially in particular fields like finance. Time series data has a temporal value attached to it, so this would be something like a date or a timestamp that you can look for trends in time.\n",
        "Text : Text data is basically just words. A lot of the time the first thing that you do with text is you turn it into numbers using some interesting functions like the bag of words formulation.\n",
